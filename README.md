# Ant Colony Optimization
[Ant Colony Optimization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms
) is a probabilistic technique for finding paths in a graph. It mimics the behaviour of a colony of ants with parameters like pheromones, evaporation, etc to find the optimal path through a graph. It is commonly used to find solutions to the famous Traveling Salesman Problem.

# Traveling Salesman Problem
The [Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is an optimization problem for routing in a connected graph. It asks the question "Given a list of nodes and the cost to travel from each node to every other node, what is the shortest possible route that visits every node exactly once and returns to the origin node?"

This project attempts to find the solution to TSP using Ant Colony Optimization. The [documentation](./documentation.md) explains in detail about the project.
